This repo is meant to contain the Python coding dojo exercises that I have participated.

Please check out the [Coding Dojo Exercises project](https://github.com/danielpsf/python-coding-dojo/projects/1) on Project's tab to check out which exercises I have been practicing through this repository.

**Note**: As I code through TDD style (or kind of TDD style) the build will fail a lot, so don't mind if you see it failing or if you see half done exercises.
